I've got several new coop runs for you today (Along with new videos) and 1 TSE Tourist run (Thanks to moooh for discovering a faster Out of Bounds usage).<br>
Ewil also had a couple of SS2 Tourist videos on his YouTube account, I've added those to the table as well.<br>
Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter has been released and Cortez started a project to run all the levels (And I also did 1 level myself), and thus a new section was born here on the site.<br>
And in case there won't be an update very soon again (Which probably won't happen) I wish you already a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!<br><br>

<font>Big update. First of all, I needed to get a new provider because the previous one shut down its service. So I hope this one will be just as good, if not better. At least this provider grants me more space, so expect some videos of the runs in the future.<br>
Secondly, 9 new demos :) Oh and I also renamed all SS2 filenames again because the previous ExMx format was a bit confusing... So now all demos from all Serious Sam games have the same format.<br><br>

<font>It's been some time since the last update and because of that I thought it would be time for a rather big update now :) I've been quite busy with Serious Sam lately and created 12(!) new demos. ShadowWraith has also made 2 demos.<br>
Also, recently Out of Bounds has been allowed on Speed Demos Archive and since we here at SSDQ follow the rules of SDA, we too allow OoB now. And because of that I've improved both Luxor Tourist and Serious quite a lot (Especially Serious), though I must say that the level has become rather dull now ;)<br>
And also, the first 2 demos have arrived for SE Tourist (They can more or less be considered tablefillers though). It's about time I'd say!<br><br>

<font>AjAX has started some serious Serious Sam single segment speedrunning, but he also made couple IL runs.  First, a first Sand Canyon run copying stx-Vile's route, but eleven seconds faster ticking at <a href="http://www.ssdq.org/DEMOS/FE-Tourist/FE_Lv02_Tourist_134.zip">1:34</a>. Next one is Metropolis ending in <a href="http://www.ssdq.org/DEMOS/FE-Tourist/FE_Lv10_Tourist_825.zip">8:25</a>, Alley of the Sphinxes in <a href="http://www.ssdq.org/DEMOS/FE-Tourist/FE_Lv11_Tourist_501.zip">5:01</a> improving 24 seconds over the sarou's record and the last, the biggest and the longest The Great Pyramid in <a href="http://www.ssdq.org/DEMOS/FE-Tourist/FE_Lv15_Tourist_1049.zip">10:49</a>.
I have managed to improve Sewers to <a href="http://www.ssdq.org/DEMOS/FE-Tourist/FE_Lv09_Tourist_123.zip">1:23</a>, just a second faster than TheVoid, who did another improvement of ZumZum level, this time clocking at <a href="http://www.ssdq.org/DEMOS/SS2-Tourist/SS2_Lv14_Tourist_036.zip">0:36</a>.</font>

<font>Kibumbi has improved Riverdance on Serious with 1 second to a <a href="http://www.ssdq.org/DEMOS/SS2-Serious/SS2_Lv02_Serious_123.zip">1:23</a>. That was the good news... The bad news is that Kibumbi also found out that there's something wrong with Serious Sam 2. It has something to do with different resolutions, maybe even quality settings\hardware, which makes the game behave "differently" on each system\user config. We're not sure yet if maybe everyone can use the same config so it's fair for everyone when speedrunning SS2, or else it's not good... :( Let's hope this can get solved somehow in someway.</font>
