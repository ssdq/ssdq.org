This section will contain stuff like funny/unusual things that happened during attempting the levels, trick demos showing things which won't be used in speedruns, or a different kind of run through the levels.<br>
You need game version 1.07 to play the demos.<p><br><br>


Demo - <a href="http://www.ssdq.org/DEMOS/ExtraSection/Kleer_Hat.zip">Kleer Hat</a><br>
Video - <a href="http://www.ssdq.org/DEMOS/ExtraSection/Kleer_Hat.mp4">Kleer Hat (Video created by dex)</a><p>

This was a funny thing that happened to BoltR when we were cooping Sierra de Chiapas on Tourist. A Kleer jumped on his head and stayed there for a moment, the situation was conveniently named "Kleer Hat" :) Pretty awesome.<br>
To switch view in the demo, press num plus or num minus. You can also switch to multiview with num 1-4.<p><br>


Demo - <a href="http://www.ssdq.org/DEMOS/ExtraSection/TheGrandCathedral_NoDamage_Serious_DavizZz.zip">No-Damage run on Serious by DavizZz</a><p>

DavizZz made a No-Damage run on Serious through the long corridor in the level The Grand Cathedral. He did get hit a bit at the end because of the explosion of one of the Cannonballs, but we'll forgive him for that ;) It's a nice run.<br>
A while back I made a video for him but I don't have that video anymore. I'll probably create another video sometime in the future.<br>
Also, I should note that he got all weapons right away and maxed his health, armor, and ammo (Or at least enough of it ;)). And DavizZz intentionally used no Serious Bombs to make it more interesting.<br>
The run length is 0:32:44.<p><br><br>
