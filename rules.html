<font>Well, rules are simple. If you want to submit a new time, just send <a href="mailto:ewil@centrum.cz">ME</a> a demo with an end level screenshot (crucial for verifying) compressed in zip or rar with some description like what difficulty it is, which game and so on. We won't accept videos (Except for Serious Sam HD since it has no demo feature), because they can be manipulated (timescale). Make sure you record with the latest patch, we won't accept demos in different version or recorded with a mod (see game sections for version details). If you think some section is missing or you want to submit a custom level demo, contact us and we will discuss that.</font>
